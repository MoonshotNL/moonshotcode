In order to compile and install this module, follow these instructions.

Dependencies:
	-openssl-devel 1.0.0 or later
	-gcc
	-make

1. Get the FreeRADIUS 2.1.12 source code
2. Compile and install FreeRADIUS using the following commands in the source root of FreeRADIUS 2.1.12:
	./configure
	make
	make install
3. Copy the module source into .../freeradius_source/src/modules/rlm_moonshot/
4. In the rlm_moonshot directory, run the following commands:
	./configure
	make
	make install
5. Register the following attributes in the FreeRADIUS dictionary (/usr/local/share/freeradius/dictionary):
	ATTRIBUTE	Moonshot-Certificate	245	string
	ATTRIBUTE	Moonshot-Request		246	string
	ATTRIBUTE	Moonshot-IDPReply		247	string
	ATTRIBUTE	Moonshot-ProxyReply	248	string
6. Create the config file /usr/local/etc/raddb/moonshot:
	moonshot {
		pub_key = "path/to/key.pem"
		priv_key = "path/to/privkey.pem"
		priv_key_password = "privkey.pem password"
	}
7. Add "moonshot" to the following sections of the /usr/local/etc/raddb/sites-enabled/default config file:
	post-auth
	pre-proxy
	post-proxy

Following these steps should succesfully get the FreeRADIUS Moonshot module to work next time the FreeRADIUS daemon is run.
