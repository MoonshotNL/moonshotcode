How-To RADIUSv2 modules:

1. setup.sh:
	-Updates existing packages
	-Installs make, gcc, wget and openssl-devel
	-Downloads, compiles and installs freeradius 2.1.12 (CentOS stable version)
	-Prepares a directory in /usr/src/freeradius-2.1.12/src/modules/rlm_testing for a testing module with neccesary configure, makefile and source files ready.

2. Editing the example module (rlm_testing.c):
	-37: struct containing configuration information, can be removed
	-53: Mapping the modules config file attributes to the struct at line 37. Can be removed as well
	-73: The init function. All but the "return 0;" line can be removed for now
	-106: Authorize function. We don't really want to authorize people, can be left empty (safe for the return)
	-146: Authenticate function. Idem dito.
	-156: Not interesting
	-170: Not interesting
	-189: Not interesting
	-203: Exit method. Free up any allocated resources
	-218: Where all the magic happens. This binds the different functions to their API hook. We're interested in pre- or post-proxy for cert injection and post-auth for adding attribute requests if the message is determined to be an Access-Accept.
	
3. Building and testing the example module (rlm_testing.c):
	If you didn't fuck anything up editing the module (unedited this works):
	-In /usr/src/freeradius-2.1.12/src/modules/rlm_testing, do "make; make install"
	-In /usr/local/etc/raddb/modules add file "testing" containing:
		testing {
		
		}
	-In /usr/local/etc/raddb/sites-enabled/default, add "testing" in the appropriate segments (i.e.: post-auth { ... testing ... })
	-For a test user account, add the following to /usr/local/etc/raddb/users:
		testing Cleartext-Password := "password"
	-Start "radiusd -X"
	-Testing with "radtest testing password 127.0.0.1 0 testing123"
